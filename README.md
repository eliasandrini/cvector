## CVector
C library for C++ like vectors. Contains most of the C++ standard library methods for vectors, with some extra utilities for print and simple computations (`sum`, `max`, `min`, `find`).

### TODO
- sorting and other vector algorithms
- type templates
- CMake: build and install on the system
- better error handling
